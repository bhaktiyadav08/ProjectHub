  Topic-Import and export in react and javascript:-
   In React, importing and exporting components refer to the process of sharing and using components across different files in your application
* export – Making something available to other files
   You export a function, component, or variable from a file so that it can be used somewhere else.

*import – Bringing something into a file.

  - You import what was exported from another file to use it.
  -"To import something in a file, we need to export it and while importing we need to mention the name of the file in which that component is exported."
  - import and exports are used when we want to utilize function or object from one file to another.
  ---Default is used when you want to export only one main value from a file.
  ---Sometimes a file contains only one main thing — like one component, one function, or one   object — that you want to share with other files.
  In such cases, you use **export default** .


--We use / at the end of a JSX tag to close it immediately when the tag doesn't have any children inside it.  Use / to close a tag in one line when it doesn’t wrap any other element or content.

Topic:- Need of react--
  Problem in Plain HTML/JS	              React's Solution
1)Code repetition	                         🔁 Reusable components
2)Manual DOM updates	      ⚡ Automatic UI re-rendering
3)Complex structure	                    📦 Organize via files/components
4)Hard to maintain state              	        💾 Easy state & data flow
5)Mixing logic + UI messy	   ✨ JSX keeps both together, cleanly
6)Big apps = chaos	                    🚀 React makes big apps possible, smooth


**🔔 In React:
-A prop is a way to pass data from one component to another.
  You can think of props like arguments passed to a function.
   🧪 Props Are Like Function Parameters
    React doesn’t care what prop names you use — you define them yourself.

 **Why do we need a wrapper like <div> or <> </> in React?
React components must return a single parent element.
  ❌ This will throw an error:-->

               function Example() {
                 return (
                 <h1>Hello</h1>
                   <p>World</p>
                 );
               }
❗ Error:
JSX expressions must have one parent element.

✅ React wants ONE return container
Think of it like this:

React needs to return one block that wraps everything — whether it’s:
a <div>
a section
a React Fragment (<> </>)
or any single parent element
